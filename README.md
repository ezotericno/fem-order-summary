## My process

Since my last challenge I got my workflow better set. The first thing I did was setup all of the files and make sure in my scss files things were getting forwarded. I set up all of the variables, resets, baselines and, configurations I needed. After configuring the page I went about setting up the page in a top down approach. Since this was a card I just started from the top element and worked my way down to the bottom. I saved the the special effects or responsive effects for last since I got to see how it all came together. 

### Built with

- HTML
- Scss
- Github Codespacess:
  - Extensions used
    - Live Server
    - Live Sass Compiler
    - Prettier

### What I learned

I actaully used most of my previous knowledge for this project. The two links below are the only things I had to look up. I learned from all the trial and error from the last challenge and was able to finish this relatively quickly. Using every tool at my desposal, and setting up my environment correctly was the keys to success this time around. 


### Continued development

I wanted to incorperate ```@mixin```'s or other cools things from Sass, but this time was a good way to practice my fundementals. Maybe with some more responsive sites or challanges that take more time I will try and make use of more that Sass has to offer. I definately want to use Javascript in my next challenge, or at least try to tackle somethings with a more complex layout.
